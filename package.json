Project Overview\n1.1 Purpose\nThe Alberta Regulations Fine Analyzer is a web application designed to support the Artificial Intelligence Maximalist Program for the Alberta Government. For the Minimum Viable Product (MVP), the app will:\n\nIngest regulations via manual uploads, URL crawling, or bulk additions, with options for predefined lists of sources (e.g., hunting/wildlife regulations) and example crawler configurations.\nExtract fine amounts and related metadata (e.g., effective dates).\nRecommend inflationary increases to fine amounts, including reasoning based on inflation data from a source of truth.\nProvide predictive analysis for forecasting future inflation impacts on fines, with recommended time horizons of 5 and 10 years (configurable), using linear regression (recommended for MVP due to simplicity, interpretability, and low implementation effort with libraries like statsmodels in backend processing) or AI-based models (e.g., via selected API for more accurate, non-linear predictions if historical trends are complex; linear regression preferred initially as it provides the most significant value—basic forecasting—with least effort).\nGenerate recommendations for fines that should be reviewed, updated, or possibly removed, based on criteria like age thresholds (e.g., unchanged for >10 years), adjustment percentages (e.g., recommended increase >20%), and other factors such as enforcement frequency (if data provided by user, as public sources are limited). Prioritize recommendations for high-impact fines (e.g., those with largest adjustment needs or highest original amounts) to deliver the most significant value with least effort.\nOffer visualizations, reports, and tools for users to review and align fines, with options for custom inflation percentages.\n\nFuture versions may include advanced features like redundancy/contradiction analysis. The app incorporates AI maximally for tasks like fine extraction, inflation reasoning, and predictive forecasting, with support for multiple AI providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, xAI).\n1.2 Scope\n\nIn Scope (MVP): Ingestion of text-based regulations (PDF, HTML, WORD/DOCX, JSON, Markdown, including OCR for scanned images), extraction of fine-related data, inflation adjustment recommendations with reasoning and custom options, predictive forecasting (5-10 years, linear/AI models), recommendations for review/update/remove (based on specified criteria, prioritized for impact/effort), user interface for uploads and analysis, reporting.\nOut of Scope: Real-time enforcement integration, legal advisory features, integration with external government systems, redundancy/contradiction analysis (deferred), multi-user collaboration (deferred), mobile app version.\n\n1.3 Assumptions\n\nRegulations are publicly available on Alberta government websites (e.g., alberta.ca, open.alberta.ca, albertaregulations.ca).\nInflation data sourced from Statistics Canada (source of truth for Alberta CPI, via Table 18-10-0005-01 for historical annual data; downloadable/customizable tables; general StatsCan Web Data Service API available at https://www.statcan.gc.ca/en/developers/wds for programmatic access). Alberta Economic Dashboard as secondary for visualizations. Historical data pre-loaded or fetched; custom percentages user-configurable.\nEnforcement frequency data is not readily available publicly (searches yield limited datasets, e.g., sector-specific like energy compliance on open.alberta.ca; no comprehensive fine enforcement statistics). App will allow manual user input for this factor.\nAI components will use configurable APIs (OpenAI, Anthropic, xAI) for NLP tasks like fine extraction and reasoning generation.\nUsers are government employees with basic authentication; non-government use allows manual API key updates via admin interface.\n\n1.4 Constraints\n\nCompliance with Alberta government standards: Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy (FOIP) Act for data privacy, Government of Alberta Cybersecurity Strategy 2024 (e.g., NIST CSF, Zero Trust, data encryption), and accessibility best practices (WCAG 2.1/2.2 AA level, informed by Accessible Canada Act and Alberta's Accessibility Design Guide for inclusive design).\nNo installation of unlicensed software; use open-source or approved tools.\nApp must handle unknown number of regulations (potentially hundreds; design for scalability), with daily analyses possible.\nScale: <100 total users, <10 concurrent.\n\n2. Requirements\n2.1 Functional Requirements\n2.1.1 User Authentication and Roles\n\nSupport user registration/login via email/password or OAuth (e.g., Google Workspace for government accounts).\nRoles: Admin (manage users, API keys, oversee ingestion), Analyst (upload/analyze regulations), Viewer (read-only access to reports).\nFor non-government use: Admin interface to select AI model (OpenAI, Anthropic, xAI) and update API keys manually.\n\n2.1.2 Regulation Ingestion\n\nManual Upload: Users can upload files (PDF, HTML, DOCX, TXT, JSON, Markdown) via drag-and-drop or file picker. Support multi-file uploads. For scanned images/PDFs, use OCR (e.g., Tesseract.js) to extract text.\nURL Crawling: Input a single URL or list of URLs. Use a web scraper to fetch and parse content. Include predefined list in app (e.g., dropdown/selectable sources like the identified hunting/wildlife URLs: https://www.alberta.ca/fishing-hunting-and-trapping-regulations, https://albertaregulations.ca/huntingregs/, https://mywildalberta.ca/hunting/regulations/default.aspx, https://open.alberta.ca/dataset/995b1ca1-0e65-4204-b432-98e4d6ccbf46/resource/ee82d86f-aedd-497a-948c-942ba9398acb/download/fp-alberta-guide-to-hunting-regulations-2024.pdf, https://kings-printer.alberta.ca/documents/Acts/W10.pdf, https://www.canlii.org/en/ab/laws/regu/alta-reg-143-1997/latest/alta-reg-143-1997.html). Provide example configurations in UI/docs (e.g., sample JSON for crawler rules: { \"startUrl\": \"https://albertaregulations.ca/huntingregs/\", \"selectors\": { \"links\": \"a[href*='reg']\", \"content\": \".regulation-body\" }, \"depth\": 2 }).\nBulk Add: Upload a CSV/JSON file with URLs or metadata for batch processing.\nPost-ingestion: Automatically extract key data (regulation name, section, fine amount, effective date, description) using OCR/NLP via selected AI API.\nValidation: Check for duplicates based on regulation ID or title; flag errors (e.g., invalid format).\n\n2.1.3 Data Extraction and Storage\n\nParse ingested content to identify fines (e.g., regex for \"$X fine\" patterns, AI for context-aware extraction).\nStore extracted data: Regulation ID, Title, Section, Fine Amount (min/max if ranged), Effective Date, Last Amended Date, Full Text, Source URL/File, Enforcement Frequency (user-input field, optional).\nUse AI to tag regulations (e.g., categories like hunting, wildlife).\n\n2.1.4 Fine Analysis and Recommendations\n\nIdentification: Extract and list all fines from ingested regulations.\nInflationary Recommendations: Calculate recommended increases using Alberta CPI from Statistics Canada (Table 18-10-0005-01; historical data downloadable as CSV/Excel via customizable tables; API via StatsCan WDS for automation). Formula: Recommended Fine = Original Fine * (Current Alberta CPI / Alberta CPI at Effective Date), with option for custom percentages (e.g., user sets 1.5x multiplier instead of CPI-based).\n\nProvide reasoning: E.g., \"Original fine of $500 set in 2000; Alberta CPI increased by 50% since then (source: StatsCan), recommending $750 to maintain deterrent value. Custom adjustment applied: +10%.\"\nFetch/pre-load historical CPI data dynamically or from cache.\n\n\nPredictive Analysis: Forecast future inflation impacts using linear regression (recommended for MVP: simple to implement with backend libraries like statsmodels on historical CPI data, provides reliable short-term trends with minimal computational effort) or AI-based (via API for advanced scenarios; optional). Configurable horizons: 5 years (short-term planning) and 10 years (long-term strategy), with projections like \"Projected fine in 2030: $850 (based on avg. 2% annual CPI growth).\"\nRecommendations: AI-generated suggestions for fines to review/update/remove, prioritized by impact/effort (e.g., sort by largest adjustment % first for high value, low effort updates):\n\nReview: If age >10 years or enforcement frequency low (< threshold, user-set).\nUpdate: If adjustment >20%.\nRemove: If adjustment <5% and age >20 years, or enforcement frequency zero.\nAllow user-configurable thresholds.\n\n\nBatch processing for analysis on multiple regulations.\n\n2.1.5 User Interface Features\n\nDashboard: Overview of ingested regulations, stats (e.g., total fines, average recommended adjustment), with simple navigation (e.g., sidebar menu for Ingestion, Analysis, Reports).\nSearch/Filter: By keyword, date, fine range, category.\nVisualizations: Charts (e.g., bar for fine distributions, line for inflation trends and forecasts using Chart.js), tables for comparisons and recommendations (sortable, with tooltips for reasoning).\nReports: Generate PDF/CSV exports of analyses, including recommended fines, reasoning, forecasts, and prioritized recommendations.\nEditing: Allow manual overrides for extracted data, with clear instructions (e.g., inline help text: \"Enter enforcement frequency here if known; otherwise, leave blank for AI estimation.\").\nDesign: User-friendly and visually appealing with a simple UI system (minimalist layout, intuitive buttons/forms, responsive design). Use Tailwind CSS for clean, modern styling (e.g., Alberta government-inspired blues/greens for branding if assets provided; otherwise, neutral professional theme). Clear instructions via tooltips, modals, and onboarding tour (e.g., \"Step 1: Upload regulations via this button.\").\n\n2.1.6 Integration and AI Components\n\nAI Integration: Configurable APIs (OpenAI, Anthropic, xAI) for extraction, reasoning, and forecasting. Node.js libraries like LangChain for orchestration; statsmodels via code execution wrappers for linear regression.\nInflation Data: Integrate with StatsCan API/WDS for fetches; pre-load historical CSV for offline use.\nLogging: Track all ingestions, analyses, and user actions for auditing.\n\n2.2 Non-Functional Requirements\n\nPerformance: Ingestion of a single regulation < 10 seconds; analysis of 100 regs < 1 minute.\nScalability: Handle <10 concurrent users; cloud-deployable (e.g., Azure for Alberta gov).\nSecurity: Align with Government of Alberta Cybersecurity Strategy 2024: HTTPS, data encryption at rest/transit (e.g., AES-256), RBAC, input sanitization, NIST CSF compliance assessments, Zero Trust architecture, DevSecOps for secure development, fraud detection, quantum-safe readiness. FOIP Act compliance for privacy (e.g., anonymize personal data if any, audit logs).\nAccessibility: WCAG 2.1 AA compliant (e.g., alt text, keyboard navigation, color contrast); informed by Alberta Accessibility Design Guide (e.g., inclusive design for all users, wayfinding).\nUsability: Responsive, visually appealing (clean layouts, intuitive controls); best practices like mobile-first if extended, with clear instructions integrated throughout.\nReliability: 99% uptime; error handling with user-friendly messages.\nMaintainability: Modular code, unit tests (>80% coverage), documentation.\nDeployment: Containerized (Docker) for easy deployment on government servers or cloud.\nGeneral Best Practices: Follow ITIL for service management, agile development, regular security audits, user training resources.\n\n3. Architecture\n3.1 High-Level Architecture\n\nFrontend: Vue 3 (Vue Router, Pinia), Axios, Tailwind CSS, Chart.js.\nBackend: Node.js with Express.js.\nDatabase: MongoDB recommended (flexible for unstructured regulation texts and JSON-like data; scalable for unknown regulation volume; easier for AI metadata storage).\nAI Layer: API integrations for OpenAI/Anthropic/xAI; libraries like pdf-parse, docx-parser, markdown-it, Tesseract.js for OCR; statsmodels integration for forecasting.\nCrawler: Puppeteer or Cheerio, with predefined lists and example configs.\nCommunication: RESTful APIs; WebSockets for progress updates.\n\n3.2 Data Flow\n\nUser uploads/crawls → Backend validates/parses → Stores in DB.\nAnalysis request → Backend runs extraction/AI/forecasting → Returns results to Frontend.\nFrontend renders views/reports.\n\n4.

Risks and Mitigations\n\nRisk: Limited enforcement data – Mitigation: User input field, future API integrations.\nRisk: Inaccurate AI/forecasts – Mitigation: Multi-model support, manual overrides, validation against StatsCan data.\nRisk: Data privacy breach – Mitigation: FOIP compliance, encryption.\nRisk: Crawling restrictions – Mitigation: Respect robots.txt, rate limiting.\n\n=== SUBMISSION DETAILS ===\nDepartment: Technology and Innovation\nEmail: zoran.mijajlovic@gov.ab.ca\nUrgency: soon\n\n=== AI ANALYSIS RESULTS ===\nPriority: high\nValue Score: 85/100\nCategory: digital transformation\n\nReasoning: The Finalyzer project is a high-priority initiative that leverages AI to automate and enhance the analysis of regulatory fines within Alberta. It aligns with digital transformation goals by improving efficiency, accuracy, and responsiveness in managing and updating regulatory fines. The project's focus on using AI for data extraction, inflation adjustment recommendations, and predictive forecasting positions it as a forward-looking tool that can significantly improve internal government operations and regulatory compliance. Its emphasis on scalability, security, and accessibility ensures that it meets the Government of Alberta's standards and future-proofs the application against evolving requirements.\n\nProject Breakdown: The project involves developing a web application that ingests regulation data, analyzes fines, and provides recommendations for adjustments based on inflation and other criteria. Key components include AI-driven data extraction, analysis modules for inflationary recommendations and predictive forecasting, a user-friendly interface for data ingestion and report generation, and integration with Statistics Canada for CPI data.\n\nRecommendations: Begin with a detailed planning phase to ensure all government standards for security and privacy are met. Prioritize the development of a robust, scalable backend to handle the ingestion and analysis of regulations. Select AI partners carefully, with a preference for those with proven government sector experience. Engage with end-users early in the design phase to ensure the UI meets their needs. Plan for a phased rollout, starting with a pilot within a single department before expanding across the government.\n\nRisk Assessment: Potential risks include limited enforcement data, which could be mitigated by allowing user inputs and planning future API integrations. Inaccurate AI predictions could be addressed by supporting multiple AI models and allowing manual data overrides. Data privacy breaches are a concern, mitigated by strict adherence to FOIP guidelines and implementing robust encryption. Crawling restrictions can be managed by respecting robots.txt and implementing rate limiting.",
